      description: 'Soft, steamed rice cakes, typically served with chutney.',
      image: Ifood_1,
      ingredients: ['Rice - 2 cups (preferably idli rice)',
        'Urad dal (split black gram) - 1 cup',
        'Fenugreek seeds - 1/2 teaspoon',
        'Salt - to taste',
        'Water - as needed',
        'Poha (flattened rice) - 1/4 cup (optional, for a softer texture)',
        'Cooked rice - 1/4 cup (optional, for a softer texture)'],
      instructions: 'To make idli with the ingredients provided, first soak 2 cups of idli rice and 1 cup of urad dal along with 1/2 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds in plenty of water for at least 6 hours or overnight. If you prefer a softer texture, you can also soak 1/4 cup of poha. After soaking, drain the rice and dal. Grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds to a smooth, fluffy batter, adding water as needed. Then grind the rice (and poha, if used) to a slightly coarse batter, adding water as necessary. Combine both batters in a large bowl, add salt to taste, and mix well. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it has doubled in volume and appears bubbly. Once the batter is fermented, grease idli molds, pour the batter into the molds, and steam them in a steamer or large pot with a steaming rack for about 10-15 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick; if it comes out clean, the idlis are ready. Serve the hot idlis with coconut chutney, sambar, or your favorite chutney.'

      image: Bfood_1,
      ingredients: ['2 cups basmati rice',
        '500g meat (chicken, lamb, or goat)',
        '2 large onions, thinly sliced',
        '2 tomatoes, chopped',
        '1 cup yogurt',
        '2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste',
        '1 teaspoon cumin seeds',
        '1 teaspoon coriander powder',
        '1 teaspoon turmeric powder',
        '2 teaspoons garam masala',
        '1 teaspoon red chili powder',
        'A few strands of saffron soaked in warm milk',
        'Fresh mint leaves',
        'Fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves',

        'Fried onions (optional)',
        'Whole spices: 2 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 2 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick'],
      instructions: 'To prepare biryani, start by rinsing 2 cups of basmati rice under cold water until it runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain. Boil a large pot of water with a pinch of salt and a few drops of oil. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% done, then drain and set aside. For the meat, marinate 500g of chicken, lamb, or goat in a mixture of 1 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. In a deep pan, heat 4 tablespoons of ghee or oil. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and whole spices (2 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 2 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick). Once fragrant, saut√© 2 sliced onions until golden brown. Add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Add the marinated meat and cook until tender. Mix in 1 teaspoon coriander powder and 2 teaspoons garam masala. In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the rice, followed by the meat mixture, fresh mint, and cilantro. Top with the remaining rice, saffron milk, and ghee. Cover tightly and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving hot.'
